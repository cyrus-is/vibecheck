  Security AND data-sensitivity review of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers before you trust them.
  Audits an MCP server's install/config, its exposed tool surface (tools/list), and its source code when
  obtainable, then emits a per-server SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCK security verdict PLUS a separate data-sensitivity
  rating (how much / how sensitive the data it can access is). Use this skill whenever the user says
  /mcp-review, asks to "review an MCP", "audit an MCP server", "is this MCP safe to install", "what data does
  this MCP access", "check this mcp config", or pastes a claude_desktop_config.json / .mcp.json / tools/list to
  evaluate. This is NOT an MCP server itself and it does NOT start servers, call tools, or fetch URLs — it is a
  conservative reviewer that reasons over static evidence.

# /mcp-review

Audit an MCP server before you trust it. Installing an MCP server grants it tool access, data access, and
often a live credential. This skill makes that trust decision inspectable — **before** the server runs.

You are an AGENT, not a scanner. The bundled analyzer (`analyze_mcp.py`) does the deterministic,
reproducible work — parsing config, flagging known patterns, tagging data categories, computing stable
digests. Your job is the judgment the analyzer can't do: read source when it exists, reason about how
findings chain, weigh the trust decision, and write the verdict. The analyzer produces evidence; **you**
produce the verdict.

This skill reports on **two independent axes**. Never merge them:

1. **Security** — *Is it safe?* → `SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCK`
2. **Data sensitivity** — *How much / how sensitive is the data it wants?* → `MINIMAL / LIMITED / SENSITIVE / HIGHLY_SENSITIVE`

A server can be perfectly secure (SAFE) and still want to read every message you've ever sent
(HIGHLY_SENSITIVE). Both belong in the report, side by side.

## Invocation

```
/mcp-review                         # Review every server in the auto-discovered config
/mcp-review <server-name>           # Review one named server
/mcp-review --config <path>         # Review a specific config file
/mcp-review --tools <path>          # Also consume a tools/list JSON for the tool-surface pass
/mcp-review --allowlist <path>      # Also check the client's permission grants for approval drift
/mcp-review --help                  # Show help and stop
```

- `--config` (optional): path to an MCP client config. If omitted, auto-discover (see below).
- `--tools` (optional): path to a captured `tools/list` response JSON. Enables Pass 2.
- `--allowlist` (optional): path to a `settings.json` / `.mcp.json` whose `permissions` block is checked
  for approval drift (see below). Often the same file as `--config`.
- A bare argument that isn't a flag is treated as a **server name** to scope the review to.

### Config auto-discovery

When `--config` is not given, look (in order) for:

1. `.mcp.json` at the repo / working-directory root
2. `.claude/settings.json` (reads its `mcpServers` block)
3. Claude Desktop config:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

If several exist, ask the user which to review rather than guessing.

## Before you start

1. **Locate the analyzer.** It lives next to this skill in the vibecheck repo as
   `mcp-review/analyze_mcp.py`, run via its venv (`mcp-review/.venv/bin/python`). If you can't find it,
   tell the user and fall back to doing the config/tool parsing yourself by hand — but note that
   digest-bound suppression won't work without it.
2. **Redaction.** The review artifact should stay shareable. Never paste raw secret values into your
   output. The analyzer already refuses to echo live secret values — preserve that discipline in your
   own prose. If you had to read an unredacted config, treat any live secret as a HIGH finding
   (`unredacted_secret_value`) and tell the user to rotate + redact.
3. **Static-first.** Do NOT start the server, call its tools, or fetch its URLs to do this review.
   Requiring the server to run means the user already executed the thing they're trying to evaluate —
   that defeats the purpose. Pass 1 needs nothing running. Pass 2 needs tool *metadata*, ideally from a
   capture; Pass 3 needs *source*, read-only.

## Pass 1 — Config review (static, no server run)

Run the analyzer over the config. This pass answers: **should I install this at all?**

```bash
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/analyze_mcp.py \
  --config <config-path> \
  [--server <name>] \
  [--suppressions .claude/mcp-review-suppressions.json]
```

The analyzer returns normalized JSON. For each server it flags deterministic config smells — interpret
each one with context:

| Finding | What it means | Your judgment |
|---|---|---|
| `shell_wrapper` | Launched via `sh -c` / `bash -c` / `powershell` | Read the full command string. Opaque chaining is a real risk; a trivial wrapper may be benign. |
| `package_runner_install` | `npx`/`uvx`/`bunx`/`dlx` fetches & runs at launch | Combined with `unpinned_source` this is a live remote-code path — weigh accordingly. |
| `unpinned_source` | No exact version / SHA pin | The reviewed code can change with no diff. On a runner install this is HIGH. |
| `non_https_remote` | Cleartext `http://`/`ws://` to non-localhost | HIGH off-host; **downgrade to INFO if the host is localhost**. |
| `credentials_in_url` | Secret in userinfo or query param | HIGH — URLs leak into logs and proxies. |
| `sensitive_env_required` | Requires credential-like env keys | Not a vuln — a **blast-radius signal**. Note which tools could exfiltrate the credential (feeds Pass 2). |
| `unredacted_secret_value` | A live secret value is in the config | HIGH. Rotate + redact. The value is never recorded by the analyzer. |
| `broad_filesystem_scope` | Pointed at `/`, `~`, a drive root, etc. | Scope creep — recommend narrowing. |

Apply your threat model: a finding's severity depends on transport, exposure, and what the server can
reach. The analyzer's severity is a **default**, not the last word.

## Pass 2 — Tool-surface review (consumes tools/list)

This pass answers: **what does the exposed tool surface actually let it do, and what data does it see?**

Provide a captured `tools/list` response via `--tools`. Obtaining it safely:

- Best: a `tools/list` JSON captured out-of-band (the server's docs, a sandboxed probe, a prior session).
- Acceptable: if the server is *already* connected in this Claude Code session and you can enumerate its
  tools, use that metadata.
- Do **not** install-and-run an untrusted server *solely* to enumerate its tools as part of deciding
  whether to trust it. That inverts the review.

The analyzer tags every tool on two axes:

**Candidate capabilities** (what it can DO) — these are a **recall-oriented prefilter**, not a verdict.
Each hit is marked `basis: "declared"`, meaning it came from the tool's *own naming/description* — which a
malicious server controls. Do **not** classify on the regex hit alone. For each candidate, refine:

1. **Schema semantics & name-vs-schema mismatch** — read `inputSchema`: required properties, types, enums,
   examples, and parameter names (`command`, `path`, `url`, `token`, `sql`, `headers`, `script`). A tool
   blandly named `helper` with a `command: string` parameter is code execution regardless of its
   description. The analyzer pre-computes `schema_signals` per tool — `power_params` (exec/abstract params),
   `destructive_flags`, and `arbitrary_input` (an `args[]` array or `additionalProperties: true`). **The
   highest-signal finding is a mismatch**: a benign name (`format_json`, `get_weather`) with a powerful or
   open-ended schema is the classic evasion shape — a "Swiss-army-knife" tool built to slip past signature
   checks. Treat any `power_params`/`arbitrary_input` on an innocuously-named tool as a reason to demand
   source before allowing it.
2. **Handler source** (Pass 3, when available) — what the handler *actually does* with the parameter. This
   is `basis: "implemented"` and **overrides declared**: source can both confirm a capability the metadata
   hid and clear a scary-sounding name that does something benign.
3. **Classify** each tool **allow / ask / deny**, weighting implementation evidence over naming:
   - `code_execution`, `privilege_escalation` → **deny** by default; require strong justification.
   - `file_write`, `file_delete`, `network_egress`, `secrets_access`, `database_access` → **ask** by default.

Remember the `tools/list` trust problem: a server can advertise benign metadata for review and behave
differently at runtime ("rug pull"). This is why source/provenance outweigh `tools/list`, and why the tool
surface is digested — so a later redefinition is at least *detectable* on re-review.

**Toxic combinations.** The analyzer also emits `toxic_combinations` — individually-tolerable capabilities
that together form a complete attack primitive (`secrets_access` + `network_egress` = read-then-send exfil;
`code_execution` + secret access; file mutation + egress; broad-read + egress). Treat each as a single
HIGH finding in its own right, separate from the individual tools. These are usually your highest-value
findings — report them prominently.

**Data categories** (what data it SEES) — feed the data-sensitivity profile (below).

## Provenance & containment (from the analyzer, per server)

The analyzer emits two evidence blocks per server. Use them — they drive the verdict (below).

**Provenance** answers *"can I tie the code I reviewed to the code that will run?"*
- `pin_strength`: `commit_sha` / `exact` (immutable) › `version_tag` › `range` › `latest` / `none`
  (mutable). Only the first two actually bind.
- `runtime_binding_confidence`: `strong` (exact/SHA) / `weak` (tag) / `none` (range/latest/floating) /
  `local_binary` (whatever's installed on disk — inspect it) / `remote_endpoint` (the endpoint controls
  behavior — unbindable).
- `mutable_install_path`: true when a package runner pulls a non-exact spec at launch. **A `true` here means
  your source review covers _a_ version, not necessarily the one that executes** — state that explicitly and
  let it cap the verdict (see rubric). `signature_status` is reported but absence is weak signal (few MCP
  servers ship attestations yet).

**Containment** answers *"how bounded is it if it misbehaves?"* — transport, localhost exposure, network
exposure, filesystem scope, sandbox evidence, and privilege notes. Static config can't *prove* a sandbox,
so `sandbox_evidence` is `none_detected` unless you find containment in the source/deploy config.

## Pass 3 — Source review (whenever source is available)

If source is obtainable — an open-source repo, the published package source, or a local path — **review
it**. This is a core pass, not an optional extra: if you can read it, you review it. Closed-source/binary
servers are the only ones that skip it (see degradation, below).

**Fetching source is itself an active, weaponizable operation — use the bundled helper, never a package
manager.** `fetch_source.py` does the acquisition deterministically so the most dangerous step in the
review isn't left to prompt adherence. It resolves the artifact through the registry HTTP APIs (or a
commit-pinned GitHub tarball), downloads the content-addressed bytes, verifies the registry integrity
digest, and extracts with a path-sanitizing extractor that rejects zip-slip (`../../`), symlinks, hardlinks,
absolute paths, and special files. It **never invokes npm/pip/git and never executes fetched code**, so no
lifecycle/`postinstall` script or git hook can run. Network egress is gated behind `--fetch`.

```bash
# Chain off the analyzer (recommended): reads the server's provenance.spec + launch command
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/fetch_source.py --analysis analysis.json --server github --fetch
# …or point it at a spec directly:
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/fetch_source.py --npm "@scope/pkg@1.2.3" --fetch
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/fetch_source.py --github owner/repo --ref <40-hex-sha> --fetch
```

Without `--fetch` it prints an **offline plan** — what it would download and the predicted match — so the
action stays inspectable before any egress. Review the extracted tree **read-only**; never run it. If the
manifest reports `extraction.tampering_detected: true` (a member tried to escape the extract dir or smuggle
a symlink/hardlink), treat that as a **BLOCK-level** malice signal in its own right — an artifact that
attacks its reviewer is hostile.

**Tie what you review to what actually runs (the Phantom-Artifact problem) — now a checked fact.** The
manifest's `source_artifact_match` answers it deterministically; don't re-derive it by hand:
- `verified` — the bytes you reviewed **are** the runtime artifact (exact version pin or commit SHA, with
  the integrity digest checked). Source findings bind to what executes.
- `unverifiable` — you reviewed *a* version, not necessarily the one that runs (a dist-tag/range/`latest`/
  floating branch — i.e. `mutable_install_path: true` — or a tampering attempt was detected). Emit the
  explicit warning: *"Reviewed source at &lt;ref&gt;, but cannot verify the registry/runtime artifact
  matches it,"* and let it cap the verdict (see rubric).
- `unfetchable` — remote endpoint / local binary / closed source: there is no artifact to bind. Degrade as
  below.

If you can't fetch safely or the helper is unavailable, say so and treat the server as effectively
closed-source for this review.

**Look for obfuscation** — it is a BLOCK-level signal in source meant to be auditable: minified/packed code
in what should be readable source, base64/hex blobs decoded at runtime, dynamic `eval`/`exec`/`Function()`
that takes a tool parameter, or network fetch-then-execute. Legitimate MCP servers don't hide their logic.

Review the tool handlers for:
- **Injection vectors** in tool parameters (the schema says `string`; does the handler shell out / build a
  query / interpolate a path with it?)
- **Secret handling** — where do the env credentials flow? Logged? Sent anywhere?
- **Outbound network / exfil paths** — does a "read" tool also phone home?
- **Sandbox / privilege scope** — does it run with more than it needs? Can it escape its working dir?
- **Dependency / supply chain** — unpinned deps, install scripts, known-bad packages.

Source findings use the same severity vocabulary as the security review (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) and a
concrete exploit path, just like `/security-review`.

### Closed-source / binary degradation

When source can't be obtained, run Passes 1–2 only and **say so plainly**:

> Code-level risks (injection in handlers, secret handling, exfil paths) could not be assessed — this
> server is closed-source/binary.

An unreviewable server is itself a signal. It cannot be `SAFE` on full confidence; cap it at `CAUTION` and
lower the confidence to reflect how little you could inspect.

## Data-sensitivity profile (reported alongside the verdict)

The analyzer aggregates the union of data categories across the server's tools into a rating:

- **HIGHLY_SENSITIVE** — touches a `critical` category: secrets, private message/email **contents**,
  source code, financial, or health data.
- **SENSITIVE** — touches a `high` category: PII, file/document contents, calendar, contacts, location,
  browsing history, system state.
- **LIMITED** — touches a `medium` category: communication *metadata* (channel lists, who/when), project
  & task status, org structure.
- **MINIMAL** — only `low`/public data, or nothing identifiable.

Report the rating **and the category breakdown**, so the reader sees the difference between "reads your
full Slack message contents + source" (HIGHLY_SENSITIVE) and "reads project names and statuses" (LIMITED).
This is independent of the security verdict — report both even when security is SAFE.

## Approval drift (client allowlist)

The trust picture isn't only what a server *could* do — it's what the client has **already authorized** it
to do without prompting. Pass `--allowlist` (a `settings.json` / `.mcp.json`) and the analyzer correlates
the granted permission rules against each tool's recommended classification, emitting an `approval_drift`
list plus a `granted` summary:

- **`approval_drift`** — a tool sitting in the allow-list (`mcp__server__tool`, a server wildcard, or
  `enableAllProjectMcpServers`) whose capabilities warrant `ask`/`deny`. Granted access exceeds what review
  recommends — HIGH when the recommendation was `deny` (e.g. an auto-approved `code_execution` tool).
- **`server_wildcard_grant`** — `mcp__server` grants every current *and future* tool with no re-review; the
  grant most exposed to tool-redefinition (rug-pull) risk.
- **`blanket_mcp_approval`** — `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` auto-approves everything.
- **`egress_with_sensitive_fs`** — a network-egress tool exposed while the client grants filesystem access
  to sensitive paths (`.env`, `.ssh`, credentials). This is a complete read-then-send exfil path → BLOCK.

Treat drift as part of the trust decision: a server whose tools are individually fine but **blanket-granted**
is riskier than one that prompts. Recommend tightening the allow-list to per-tool grants and replacing
server wildcards. Report the `granted` picture so the user sees exactly what's been authorized.

## Verdict rubric (security axis)

Don't sum smells into a score. The verdict is **hard blockers first, then a two-axis judgment.** Apply in
order:

### Step 1 — Hard BLOCK triggers (any one ⇒ BLOCK)

- A **live secret** present in the config (`unredacted_secret_value`).
- **Credentials embedded in a URL** (`credentials_in_url`).
- **Cleartext off-host transport** (`non_https_remote`).
- A **toxic combination** finding (exfil chain, exec+secrets, fs-mutation+egress, broad-read+egress).
- **Confirmed** (source-level, `basis: implemented`) arbitrary `code_execution` or `privilege_escalation`
  that isn't the server's whole legitimate purpose.
- **Unpinned remote execution**: a package-runner install with `mutable_install_path: true` **and**
  `sensitive_env_required` — i.e. an unbindable artifact handed a live credential.
- **Opaque closed-source** server that also presents **high-severity capabilities** — you can neither
  inspect it nor bound it.
- **Obfuscation in source** — minified/packed code where readable source is expected, base64/hex payloads
  decoded at runtime, or dynamic `eval`/`exec`/`Function()` wired to a tool parameter.
- **Source-acquisition tampering** — `fetch_source.py` reported `tampering_detected` (a package member
  tried to escape the extract dir or smuggled a symlink/hardlink): the artifact actively attacks its reviewer.
- **`egress_with_sensitive_fs` approval drift** — a network-egress tool is exposed while the client already
  grants filesystem access to sensitive paths (`.env`/`.ssh`/credentials): a live read-then-send exfil path.

### Step 2 — If no hard blocker, judge on two axes

Capability severity (highest unmitigated capability/finding) × inspection confidence (how much you could
actually verify — `config+tools+source` with `strong` binding is high; `config+tools` only, or `none`/
`remote_endpoint` binding, is low).

| | **High inspection confidence** | **Low inspection confidence** |
|---|---|---|
| **High capability severity** | **CAUTION** — only if strongly contained (narrow scope, sandbox, exact pin); else lean BLOCK | **BLOCK** |
| **Low capability severity** | **SAFE** | **CAUTION** |

A `mutable_install_path` / `remote_endpoint` / closed-source server **cannot be SAFE** — cap it at CAUTION,
because you can't bind what you reviewed to what runs. Concretely: any server whose `source_artifact_match`
is `unverifiable` or `unfetchable` is capped at CAUTION; only a `verified` match supports SAFE.

**Over-privilege is a CAUTION signal in its own right.** Cross-reference the credentials the server holds
(`sensitive_env_keys`) against what its tools actually appear to need: a database-viewer requesting a
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, or a web-search tool granted broad filesystem scope, is asking for more than its purpose —
least-privilege says flag it. If an over-privileged credential also meets a network-egress tool, that's a
toxic combination → BLOCK.

### Step 3 — SAFE means *scoped*, never absolute

`SAFE` = **"no material issues found within the inspected scope."** Always pair it with coverage language:
state whether it was **source-reviewed** or **config + tool metadata only**, and the
`runtime_binding_confidence`. Never present SAFE as an unconditional guarantee — the MCP ecosystem has
uneven security and hidden change paths, and an over-trusted SAFE is the main product risk.

### The data-sensitivity axis is independent

The data-sensitivity rating is **always reported and never changes the security verdict**. A server can be
`SAFE` and `HIGHLY_SENSITIVE` — "safe, but wants everything" is exactly the judgment the user needs to make
themselves, so surface it plainly rather than folding it into the security call.

## False-positive suppression (digest-bound)

The analyzer binds every finding to a SHA-256 **digest** of the fields that change the trust decision
(server: transport/command/args/env-key-names/url — *secret values excluded*; tool: name/description/
schema). A suppression matches only while its digest is unchanged, so the moment a server's args or a
tool's schema change, the finding **automatically re-enters review**.

To suppress a reviewed-and-accepted finding, append to `.claude/mcp-review-suppressions.json`:

```json
{
  "suppressions": [
    {"scope": "server", "code": "broad_filesystem_scope", "digest": "sha256:…", "reason": "dev box, OS-scoped"},
    {"scope": "tool",   "code": "network_egress",         "digest": "sha256:…", "reason": "reviewed: hard-coded host"}
  ]
}
```

Use the exact `digest` the analyzer reported for that server/tool. Pass the file back via `--suppressions`
on the next run. The analyzer marks matching findings `suppressed: true` and reports any `stale_suppressions`
(bound to a digest no longer present) so the user can prune them. Only suppress what you've actually
reviewed — never suppress to quiet a report.

## Output format

Verdict and ratings first. Per server, then an overall summary across all reviewed servers.

```
## MCP Review — `<server-name>`

**Security:** SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCK
  └ coverage: source-reviewed / config + tool metadata only · binding: strong / weak / none / remote / local-binary
**Data sensitivity:** MINIMAL / LIMITED / SENSITIVE / HIGHLY_SENSITIVE

### Summary
<1–2 sentences: what the server is, the headline security concern (if any), and what data it reaches.
For SAFE, restate the scope: "No material issues within inspected scope (config + tool metadata only).">

### Data access
<Category breakdown — what it sees and the tier. e.g.:
- Slack message contents (communications_content, critical)
- Source code (source_code, critical)
- Channel lists (communications_metadata, medium)>

### Provenance & containment
<One line each. e.g.:
- Provenance: registry, `pkg@latest` — UNPINNED, mutable install path, binding: none (review covers a version, not the one that runs)
- Containment: stdio, filesystem scope broad (`/Users`), no sandbox evidence>

### Toxic combinations
<The high-value findings — capability pairs that form an attack primitive. Omit the section if none.>
- **exfil_chain (HIGH):** reads credentials AND has network egress — read-then-send path.

### Approval drift  (when --allowlist given)
<What the client already authorized vs. what review recommends. Omit if no allowlist or no drift.>
- **server_wildcard_grant (MEDIUM):** `mcp__github` grants all current + future tools with no re-review.
- **approval_drift (HIGH):** `run_command` is auto-approved but warrants `deny` (code_execution).

### Security findings
<Only report findings that survived your judgment. For each:>

#### <code or category> — <severity> (<confidence>)
* **Where:** config key / tool name / source `path:line`
* **What:** one sentence
* **Why it matters / exploit:** concrete path or blast radius
* **Recommendation:** specific fix

### Tool classification        (Pass 2)
| Tool | Capability (basis) | Classification | Note |
|------|--------------------|----------------|------|
| run_command | code_execution (declared) | DENY | param `command: string` confirms; no handler source to clear it |
| post_webhook | network_egress (declared) | ASK | pairs with sensitive_env → exfil_chain |
```

When several servers are reviewed, add an overall table:

```
## MCP Review — Summary (N servers)

| Server | Security | Data sensitivity | Top concern |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| github | CAUTION  | HIGHLY_SENSITIVE | unpinned runner install + source access |
| tracker| SAFE     | LIMITED          | — |
```

If nothing of concern survives filtering for a server, say so cleanly — `**Security: SAFE** — no findings`
— and still report its data-sensitivity rating. Do not pad with empty sections.

## How to run the analyzer (reference)

```bash
# Config only (Pass 1)
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/analyze_mcp.py --config claude_desktop_config.json

# One server + its tool surface (Pass 1 + 2)
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/analyze_mcp.py \
  --config .mcp.json --server github --tools github-tools.json

# With approval-drift check + suppressions reconciled
mcp-review/.venv/bin/python mcp-review/analyze_mcp.py \
  --config .mcp.json --server github --tools tools.json \
  --allowlist .claude/settings.json \
  --suppressions .claude/mcp-review-suppressions.json
```

The analyzer never starts a server, calls a tool, fetches a URL, or echoes a secret value. It is a
review-artifact generator for the config and tool-surface layers; the source layer and the verdict are
yours.

## Help (--help)

If the argument is `--help`, output this and stop:

```
/mcp-review — Security + data-sensitivity review of MCP servers

USAGE:
  /mcp-review                  Review every server in the auto-discovered config
  /mcp-review <server-name>    Review one named server
  /mcp-review --config <path>  Review a specific config file
  /mcp-review --tools <path>   Also consume a tools/list JSON (tool-surface pass)
  /mcp-review --allowlist <p>  Also check the client's grants for approval drift
  /mcp-review --help           Show this help

WHAT IT DOES (three passes, static-first — never runs the server):
  1. Config review     install/transport/secret/scope smells + provenance/containment
  2. Tool-surface      capability classification (allow/ask/deny) + data categories + schema-intent
  3. Source review     handler injection, secret handling, exfil paths, obfuscation (when source available)
  +  Toxic combinations (exfil chains) and approval drift (granted vs. recommended)

REPORTS TWO AXES:
  Security          SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCK
  Data sensitivity  MINIMAL / LIMITED / SENSITIVE / HIGHLY_SENSITIVE  (reported separately)

OUTPUT:
  Per-server verdict + data profile, then an overall summary. Stays shareable —
  secret values are never echoed.
```
