## Methodology — how "top 100" is defined

**Universe.** A full snapshot of the official Model Context Protocol registry
(`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) on **{SNAPSHOT}**: {U['records']:,} records →
{U['latest']:,} unique servers at their latest version. We keep the servers that
(a) ship an **npm or PyPI package over stdio** — i.e. the locally-installable
servers that `/scrutineer-mcp` is designed to audit — and (b) link a **GitHub
repository**: **{U['installable']:,} servers across {U['repos']:,} repositories**.
({U['remote_only']:,} registry entries are remote/HTTP-only and out of scope here.)

**Ranking.** GitHub stars of the linked repository, as of {SNAPSHOT}, descending.
Top 100 taken. Stars are a **popularity proxy, not a security or quality signal** —
they answer "which servers do the most people reach for," which is exactly the
blast-radius question worth auditing first.

**Monorepo caveat.** Several entries share one repository (e.g.
`bytedance/UI-TARS-desktop` ships 4 installable servers; `microsoft/mcp` ships 3).
Each is independently installable with its own tool surface and risk profile, so
each is listed separately and shares that repo's star count. The rank reflects the
**hosting repo's** stars, not the individual package's.

**What was measured.** For each server we ran the **deterministic pass** of
`/scrutineer-mcp` over (1) its install config — synthesized from the registry's
**authoritative package metadata**, no install commands invented — and (2) its
captured `tools/list` surface. The agentic source/behavioral review was *not* run
on all 100 (it is non-deterministic and per-server costly); it was applied only to
the subset with capability findings, to clear false positives.

**Tool-surface capture.** Each server was launched in a **disposable, unprivileged
container** (node + uv) and its `tools/list` captured via the MCP handshake.
Capturing a surface means *executing* the package — so all 100 unpinned launches
were boxed in a throwaway container, never on a workstation. ({captured}/{n}
surfaces captured; servers needing real credentials or positional args to boot
failed capture and are analyzed config-only, shown as `UNKNOWN` data sensitivity.)

**Security posture is *derived*, and is a supply-chain posture — not a malware
verdict.** The SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCK column is computed deterministically from the
analyzer's evidence using the unambiguous parts of the published rubric: the
hard-BLOCK triggers (a live secret in config, credentials-in-URL, cleartext
transport, a high-confidence toxic combination, confirmed tool-poisoning, or **an
unpinned artifact handed a live credential**), plus the rule that an
unpinned/unbindable install **cannot be SAFE** (you can't bind the code that runs
to anything you reviewed). Read `BLOCK` as "don't run this as-distributed without
pinning + review," **not** "this is malware"; read `SAFE` as "no material issue in
the inspected scope," not "audited clean." Scrutineer is a provenance/transparency
gate; behavioral malice requires source review.

**Data sensitivity** is reported post-validation. The deterministic pass is
recall-first (it over-fires on purpose), so each captured surface then goes
through the agentic Pass-4 validator (suppress-only) and a manual review of every
SENSITIVE+ rating; the published tier is the highest data tier with a surviving
high-confidence category. Running this survey on 100 real servers is also what
surfaced two precision bugs in the detector itself — `health` matching system
*health-checks* (`agent_health`) as medical data, and `token` matching LLM/crypto
tokens as credentials — both fixed in **scrutineer 1.6.3** (the ratings here are
post-fix). That's the recall-first/precision-second design doing its job, in public.

## What "unpinned" means — and why we treat it as a security position

This is the survey's central call, and the one most likely to draw a "but `latest`
is good practice" reaction — so here's the reasoning, explicitly.

Pinning isn't about running *old* code. It's about the **audit boundary**: when you
pin a version (or vendor the package), the code you reviewed is the code that runs.
With `npx -y pkg` / `uvx pkg` / `@latest`, the code that runs is **whatever the
registry serves at the moment of launch** — which can change after you've vetted it,
silently, with no signal, on every run, forever. You re-extend trust to the
publisher's account + the registry + the network automatically, every time your
agent starts the server.

Auto-latest is bad practice for *any* dependency, not just MCP — it's how supply-chain
attacks spread. When `axios` (100M+ weekly downloads) was compromised in March 2026 its
malicious versions were live ~3 hours before removal; the September 2025 `chalk`/`debug`
maintainer phish lasted ~2 hours, across packages with 2.6B weekly downloads. The
control that defeats the common case is boring: **pin an exact version, and don't run a
release until it's aged ~a week** (long enough that a malicious one has usually been
caught and pulled), then bump deliberately. Not a silver bullet — a patient backdoor
like xz/liblzma aged past any cooldown — but a *strong* control, and it applies to
everything you install. MCP just raises the stakes (you've handed the server tool
access, data access, and usually a live credential, launched by an agent) and ships the
bad default: `npx -y` / `uvx`, unpinned-newest-on-every-run. postmark-mcp is the worked
example — v1.0.16 added a line BCC'ing every email to the author, and anyone on
auto-latest shipped it on the next boot.

And "latest" doesn't even mean what people assume. The version-drift check found
**38 of the 56 captured servers ran a different version than the registry declared**,
and 4 list their version as literally `latest`. Unpinned isn't "the newest reviewed
release" — it's "whatever resolved at that millisecond."

The fix is **not** "never update." It's **pin, then bump deliberately** — review the
diff and move the pin (the same discipline you'd apply to any dependency) — or vendor
the package. We rate every unpinned server at most CAUTION, never SAFE, for one
narrow and honest reason: we can't bind the code that runs to anything we reviewed.
That's a statement about *verifiability*, not about any server's intentions.

## Limitations

- Stars proxy popularity, not safety. A high-starred server is not "more dangerous"
  — it just has more blast radius if something is wrong.
- Registry package metadata can lag a server's true latest release.
- The deterministic capability pass is recall-oriented; per-capability findings, where
  shown, are validator-cleaned. The headline stats deliberately lean on **provenance
  facts** (unpinned / credentialed), which don't depend on capability precision.
- Config-only servers (capture failed) get a provenance posture but `UNKNOWN` data
  sensitivity — absence of a tool surface is *unknown*, not *minimal*.

## Manual-review corrections

Three residual semantic FPs that Pass-4 missed were removed in human review
(documented + auditable in `survey_build.py`): `unreal-engine`'s `location` (3D actor
x/y/z coordinates, not geographic), `mcp-neo4j-data-modeling`'s `location` (a data-model
column literally named "location"), and `token-optimizer`'s `calendar` (cache
cron/scheduling, not calendar data). `location`→3D and `schedule`→`calendar` are a known
calibration long-tail tracked for a follow-up release.

## Reproduce

Everything is in the repo under `mcp-review/tests/corpus/top100/`:
`build_top100.py` (registry pull + star ranking → `config.json` + `manifest.json`),
`run_capture_parallel.sh` (containerized `tools/list` capture), `run_analysis_top100.sh`
(deterministic analysis), `survey_build.py` (this file → leaderboard + stats + survey).
`manifest.json` carries the per-server stars, repo, and registry identifier for audit.
