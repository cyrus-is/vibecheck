Agentic code review toolkit for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Three generators that scan your repo and produce tailored review skills — a principal engineer peer review, a security audit, and a service topology map that makes both smarter — plus `/mcp-review`, a standalone auditor for the MCP servers you're about to trust.

## What's in the box

### generate-servicemap

Deep agentic crawl of your repository that produces `servicemap.json` — a machine-readable topology of all services, apps, libraries, datastores, infrastructure, and their connections.

The service map is useful on its own (architecture docs that stay current), but it also feeds into the other two tools. With a service map, peer review can trace cross-service impacts and the security review can flag unauthenticated endpoints and shared datastores.

**Four-phase crawl:**
1. **Discovery** — identify all components (services, apps, libraries, infra, datastores)
2. **Deep dive** — analyze each component's endpoints, auth, config, dependencies
3. **Trace connections** — map how components talk to each other (HTTP, gRPC, queues, DB)
4. **Assemble** — validate and output `servicemap.json` with confidence scores

Supports incremental updates — re-run it as your codebase evolves and it merges new findings with existing data, preserving manual overrides.

### generate-peer-review

Scans your repo and generates a Claude Code skill (`.claude/commands/peercodereview.md`) that performs principal engineer-level code review across **8 evaluation lenses**:

| Lens | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| Production Reliability | Will this survive real traffic, failures, and edge cases? |
| Correctness | Does the logic do what it claims? |
| Data Integrity | Can data be lost, corrupted, or desynchronized? |
| Error Handling | Are errors caught, surfaced, and recoverable? |
| Architecture | Does this fit the system's patterns and boundaries? |
| Operability | Can you debug, monitor, and deploy this safely? |
| Performance | Will this scale? Any hidden N+1s, unbounded queries, or hot paths? |
| Maintainability | Will someone understand this in 6 months? |

**Three review modes:**
- **Branch diff** — review your current branch vs main
- **PR review** — review a pull request by number, optionally post findings as a PR comment
- **Component review** — deep review of an entire service or app directory (requires service map)

The generated skill is customized to your repo's tech stack — it detects which platforms you use (Go, Python, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin, Terraform, etc.) and includes platform-specific pre-flight checks, focus areas, and change-type signals. 20+ platforms supported via `peer_review_guidance.yaml`.

### generate-security-review

Same scan-and-generate approach, producing `.claude/commands/security-review.md` — a security auditor skill that hunts for vulnerabilities.

**Analysis flow:**
1. **Threat model** — attack surface, trust boundaries, blast radius, auth model
2. **Universal checklist** — 11 areas including auth, injection, secrets, crypto, rate limiting, dependencies
3. **Platform-specific checklists** — vulnerability patterns for 30+ platforms with OWASP mapping
4. **Agentic analysis** — input tracing from entry to storage, auth boundary auditing, attack chain reasoning

Findings are rated CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW. Security review output stays in your terminal — it does not auto-post to PRs, because security findings may be sensitive.

### mcp-review

A standalone auditor for MCP servers — the `npm audit` equivalent for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Installing an MCP server grants it tool access, data access, and usually a live credential; `/mcp-review` makes that trust decision inspectable **before** the server runs. Unlike the generators, it reviews an *external* server rather than your repo, so there's no generate step — it's a static skill plus a runtime analyzer (`analyze_mcp.py`), evidence in Python and judgment in the skill.

It reports **two independent axes** — a server can be perfectly secure and still want to read every message you've ever sent:

- **Security verdict** — `SAFE / CAUTION / BLOCK`
- **Data-sensitivity rating** — `MINIMAL / LIMITED / SENSITIVE / HIGHLY_SENSITIVE`

**Three passes, static-first (never starts the server, calls a tool, or fetches a URL):**
1. **Config review** — install/transport/secret/scope smells, plus *provenance* (can the reviewed code be tied to what actually runs?) and *containment*
2. **Tool-surface review** — capability classification (allow/ask/deny), the data categories each tool touches, and schema-intent signals that expose the benign-name/powerful-schema evasion shape
3. **Source review** — handler injection, secret handling, exfil paths, and obfuscation, with source safely acquired by `fetch_source.py` (resolves via registry APIs, integrity-verified, path-sanitized extraction — never runs a package manager or executes fetched code)

Plus **toxic combinations** (individually-tolerable capabilities that together form an attack primitive — e.g. secrets-access + network-egress = read-then-send exfil) and **approval drift** (what your client has already auto-authorized vs. what review recommends). Findings bind to a SHA-256 digest so false-positive suppressions auto-expire the moment the server's config or tool surface changes.

See [`mcp-review/README.md`](mcp-review/README.md) for the full design.

## How the tools relate

```
generate-servicemap ──→ servicemap.json
                              │
                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                    ▼                   ▼
         generate-peer-review   generate-security-review
                    │                   │
                    ▼                   ▼
         .claude/commands/      .claude/commands/
         peercodereview.md      security-review.md
```

The service map is optional but recommended. Without it, peer review and security review still work — they just can't do cross-service analysis or component-level reviews.

## Quick start

### 1. Generate a service map (optional, recommended)

Copy `generate-servicemap/SKILL.md` to `.claude/commands/generateservicemap.md` in your target repo:

```bash
cp generate-servicemap/SKILL.md /path/to/your-repo/.claude/commands/generateservicemap.md
```

Then in Claude Code, inside your repo:

```
/generateservicemap --path servicemap.json
```

Validate the output:

```bash
python generate-servicemap/validate_servicemap.py servicemap.json
```

### 2. Generate review skills

```bash
# Peer review skill
python generate-peer-review/generate.py /path/to/your-repo \
  --output .claude/commands/peercodereview.md

# Security review skill
python generate-security-review/generate.py /path/to/your-repo \
  --output .claude/commands/security-review.md
```

Both generators **auto-discover `servicemap.json` at the repo root** when present, producing the richer cross-service-aware skill. Pass `--service-map /path/to/servicemap.json` for a non-standard location, or `--no-service-map` to deliberately skip it.

### 3. Use the skills

In Claude Code, inside your repo:

```
/peercodereview                    # Review current branch diff
/peercodereview --pr 123           # Review a pull request
/peercodereview --component api    # Deep review of a component

/security-review                   # Security audit of current branch diff
/security-review --pr 123          # Audit a pull request
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `pyyaml>=6.0` (`pip install pyyaml`)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to run the generated skills

## Customizing

The review tools are driven by YAML guidance files:

- **`generate-peer-review/peer_review_guidance.yaml`** — platform detection rules, pre-flight checks, focus areas, and change-type signals for peer review
- **`generate-security-review/security_guidance.yaml`** — platform detection rules, vulnerability checklists with OWASP mapping, and secure alternatives

To add a new platform or customize checks for your stack, add entries to these files. The generators will pick them up automatically. Both tools also self-heal — if they detect a platform in your repo that isn't in the guidance file, they'll flag it and offer to enrich the guidance.

The service map schema is documented in `references/schema.md`.

## Supported platforms

**Backend:** Go, Python, Java, Node.js, Rust, C#, Ruby, PHP
**Web:** React/Next.js, Vue/Nuxt
**Mobile:** iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin)
**Infrastructure:** Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions
