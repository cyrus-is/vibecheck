"""Locate the toolkit's bundled assets.

The generators, guidance YAMLs and static SKILL.md files live in the tool
directories at the repo root. They are resolved from one of two places:

* **clone / ``pip install -e .``** — the directories sit as siblings of this
  package, one level up from ``scrutineer/``.
* **installed wheel** — the build (Hatchling ``force-include``) copies those
  directories into ``scrutineer/_assets/``, so a ``pip install scrutineer`` with
  no clone still has everything the installer needs.

``toolkit_root()`` returns whichever of the two is present, so the installer
works identically from a clone and from a published wheel.
