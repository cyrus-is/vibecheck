"""Obtain a ``servicemap.json`` for a target repo.

The service map is the one input the deterministic installer cannot produce on
its own: building it is an agentic crawl that only Claude can run. This module
resolves a map by the best method available to the caller:

* ``reuse``  — an existing ``servicemap.json`` at the target root is used as-is.
* ``crawl``  — shell out to ``claude -p '/scrutineer-servicemap ...'`` to run the
               crawl headlessly. Requires the ``claude`` CLI on PATH and the
               servicemap skill already installed in the target repo.
* ``skip``   — no map; the generators run with ``--no-service-map``.

The ``/scrutineer-setup`` skill never calls ``crawl`` here — Claude is already
running, so it does the crawl itself and then hands the resulting path to the
installer via ``service_map=``.
