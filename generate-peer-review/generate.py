Peer Review Skill Generator

Scans a repository (and optionally consumes a servicemap.json) to generate a
tailored .claude/commands/peercodereview.md with platform-specific pre-flight
checks, focus areas, and evaluation lenses.

The generated skill supports three invocation modes:
  /peercodereview          — review current branch diff vs main
  /peercodereview 123      — review PR #123 (git pull + checkout)
  /peercodereview neighbors — full review of a service/app from the service map

Usage:
    python generate.py /path/to/repo
    python generate.py /path/to/repo --service-map tools/servicemap.json
    python generate.py /path/to/repo --dry-run

            This skill supports three modes based on the argument:

            ### Mode 1: Current Branch Diff (no arguments)
            ```
            /peercodereview
            ```
            Reviews the current branch's changes against main. Runs `git diff main...HEAD`.

            ### Mode 2: PR Review (numeric argument)
            ```
            /peercodereview 123
            ```
            Reviews PR #123. Process:
            1. `git fetch origin`
            2. Get PR metadata: `gh pr view 123 --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName`
            3. Get full diff: `gh pr diff 123`
            4. Review the diff.
            5. Post findings as a PR comment via `gh pr comment`.

            ### Mode 3: Full Service/App Review (component name argument)
            ```
            /peercodereview <component-name>
            ```
            Full review of all code in a service or app directory — not just a diff. This is for
            comprehensive reviews of an entire component.

            Process:
            1. Identify the component directory from the service map (see table below).
            2. Read all source files in that directory.
            3. Apply pre-flight checks, focus areas, and all 8 lenses.
            4. Report findings in the same format as PR review, but without the PR metadata.

            ### Mode 4: Deep Repo Review (--deep flag)
            ```
            /peercodereview --deep
            ```
            Full repository-level review that traces flows across services, compares patterns
            cross-service, and finds systemic issues that component-level reviews miss. This is
            the most thorough mode — it finds data integrity bugs in multi-step flows, architectural
            inconsistencies, and cross-layer configuration gaps.

            **This mode finds a DIFFERENT CLASS of bugs than Modes 1-3.** Component reviews scan
            files and match patterns. Deep review traces flows end-to-end and asks "what breaks
            when these components interact?"

            5. **Pre-flight checks** — scan for known high-frequency bug patterns. These are starting points for investigation, not final answers.
            6. **Agentic analysis** — trace data flows, audit consistency, detect absences, follow signals depth-first (see below)
            7. **Detect change types** — check if the diff/files touch migrations, API contracts, auth, dependencies, or infra (see Change-Type Modifiers). Increase scrutiny on relevant lenses.
            8. **Evaluate through all 8 lenses** — rate each as PASS / CONCERN / ISSUE.
            9. **Post findings** — Mode 2: `gh pr comment <number>` with structured output. Mode 1 and 3: output to terminal.

            ## Phase 1: Understand Before Judging

            Before running any checks, build a mental model of the code. This context determines
            whether a finding is CRITICAL or INFO — a missing timeout is P0 in an auth service and
            P3 in a batch job.

            1. **What is this code's job?** Summarize in one sentence.
            2. **What are the trust boundaries?** Where does untrusted input enter? Where does
               sensitive data leave? What's authenticated vs public?
            3. **What are the failure domains?** If this component crashes, what breaks? If it's
               slow, what backs up? If it returns wrong data, who sees it?
            4. **What are the implicit contracts?** What does this code assume about its callers,
               its dependencies, and the data it receives? Are those assumptions documented or
               just hoped for?
            5. **What changed and why?** (Mode 1 and 2 only) What was the author trying to
               accomplish? Read PR description and commit messages. Understanding intent prevents
               false findings.

            Carry this model through the rest of the review. A checklist item that fires is only
            a finding if it matters given this context.

            ## Phase 3: Agentic Analysis

            This is where you earn your keep. Pre-flight checks catch known patterns — this phase
            catches the bugs that no checklist anticipates. These are active investigations, not
            pattern matches.

            ### Consistency Audit

            For every guard or restriction you encounter (auth check, rate limit, billing gate,
            input validation, size limit):
            1. Identify the resource or operation it protects
            2. Find ALL other code paths that reach the same resource/operation
            3. Verify each path has the same guard
            4. If a path is missing the guard, that's a finding — classify by what an attacker
               or unintended user could do through the unguarded path

            This is the #1 source of missed bugs. Restrictions are added to the first endpoint
            that needed them but rarely backfilled to new endpoints that touch the same resource.

            ### Trace Data Flows

            For critical inputs and outputs, trace the full path:
            1. Pick up user input at the handler boundary
            2. Follow it through validation, transformation, storage, forwarding
            3. At each step, ask: is it validated? transformed? logged? Could it be nil/null?
            4. Check the reverse: when data comes back from a dependency, what happens if it's
               malformed, null, empty, or an unexpected type?

            Don't trace every field — focus on: IDs (IDOR risk), strings that become queries,
            URLs that become HTTP calls, and values that cross service boundaries.

            ### Absence Detection

            Ask for each significant function or endpoint:
            - What error can occur here that has **no handler**?
            - What decision is made here that has **no log statement**?
            - What external call is made here that has **no timeout**?
            - What resource is acquired here that has **no cleanup on error path**?
            - What state change happens here that has **no audit trail**?
            - What failure mode exists here that has **no test**?

            Absence bugs are invisible to checklists. Only reasoning about what SHOULD be there
            but ISN'T can find them.

            ### Depth-First on Signals

            When you find a concerning pattern:
            1. Don't just log it and move on
            2. Search the codebase for the same pattern — if it's wrong here, it's probably
               wrong elsewhere
            3. Check the callers and callees of the affected code — does the bug propagate?
            4. Check if there's a test for this code path — if not, that's an additional finding

            2. **Correctness** — Hidden bugs: race conditions, lifecycle issues (app backgrounding, context cancellation, component unmounting), memory leaks/retain cycles, off-by-one, nil/null handling, type coercion surprises.

            3. **Data Integrity** — Partial writes without transactions, inconsistent state across services, cache/DB divergence, migration safety (reversibility, data loss), stale reads, eventual consistency assumptions.

            4. **Error Handling** — Swallowed errors, wrong error propagated up the stack, missing retries vs retry storms, idempotency gaps, error messages that lie about what happened, panic/crash vs graceful degradation.

            5. **Architecture** — Layering violations, coupling that shouldn't exist, abstractions at wrong level, design decisions that will hurt in 6 months, violation of established patterns in the codebase.

            6. **Operability** — Can you debug this in production? Missing logs at decision points, metrics gaps, tracing context dropped, alerting blind spots, deployment risk (rollback story?).

            7. **Performance** — N+1 queries, UI thread blocking, unnecessary re-renders, memory pressure, battery impact (mobile), unbounded allocations, missing pagination.

            8. **Maintainability** — Will the next engineer understand this? Implicit assumptions not documented, clever code that should be clear code, test coverage of the failure modes that matter (not just happy path).

            ## Mode 4: Deep Repo Review

            **Role:** You are a world-class Principal Software Engineer performing a comprehensive,
            deep-dive review of this entire repository. Do not just scan for patterns — evaluate
            the codebase as if you are preparing for a high-stakes production launch. Think like
            an engineer who has been hired to find the bugs that will page you at 2am.

            **Scope:** EVERYTHING. Backend services, mobile apps, web apps, infrastructure,
            CI/CD pipelines, configuration. No layer is out of scope. The investigations below
            are starting points — if you notice something interesting, follow it. Your best
            findings will come from pulling threads, not from checklists.

            **What makes this mode different:** Modes 1-3 review individual components in
            isolation. This mode traces flows ACROSS components and finds bugs that only exist
            in the interactions between them — data lost between a mobile sync engine and a
            server API, secrets that are encrypted in one layer but plaintext in another,
            billing limits enforced on one code path but not a parallel one.

            ### Adaptive Execution Strategy

            **Repo has {component_count} reviewable components.**

            {"**Small repo (≤20 components): Single-agent deep review.** Read the service map, then read source files as needed to trace flows. You have enough context. Prioritize depth on the most complex and highest-risk areas." if component_count <= 20 else "**Large repo (>20 components): Use sub-agents.** Dispatch sub-agents using the Agent tool — one per investigation area. Each sub-agent gets a fresh context and reads only the files relevant to its investigation. Collect findings, then synthesize."}

            ### Investigation 1: Trace Critical User Flows End-to-End

            Pick the 3-5 most complex user flows and trace each from client → API gateway →
            internal service → database and back. Read the actual code at each step — don't
            assume. For each flow:
            - What data is created, transformed, and stored at each step?
            - What fields are present at the API boundary vs what's stored? Are any dropped?
            - What happens on FAILURE at each step? Is the system left consistent?
            - What happens if this flow runs OFFLINE and then syncs? (for mobile apps)
            - What happens if two instances of this flow run CONCURRENTLY?
            - Is the same restriction (rate limit, billing check, auth) applied on ALL paths
              that reach this flow, or can some paths bypass it?

            {"**Most-connected components (start here):**" if flow_hints else ""}
            {flow_hints}

            ### Investigation 2: Cross-Service Pattern Comparison

            For each pattern, check if ALL services implement it the same way.
            Inconsistency = bug or tech debt:

            - **Error handling**: Do all services sanitize DB errors before logging? Or do some leak PII?
            - **PATCH semantics**: Do all services handle nil-vs-omit the same way?
            - **Input validation**: Do all services validate string lengths? Escape ILIKE wildcards?
            - **Pagination**: Do all list endpoints accept client pagination? Or are some hardcoded?
            - **Batch endpoints**: If one service has a batch endpoint, do similar services have one too?
            - **Auth/admin separation**: Are destructive operations on the admin router or regular API?
            - **Transaction boundaries**: Are multi-step writes wrapped in transactions consistently?
            - **Billing/limit enforcement**: Is every path that consumes a paid resource checked?

            ### Investigation 3: Cross-Layer Secret & Config Audit

            Trace every secret from storage → infrastructure → application runtime:
            - Read the Terraform/IaC files. Is every secret referenced as a `secret` in task
              definitions, not a plain `environment_variable`?
            - Are any secrets logged? (error messages, debug output, audit logs)
            - Are any secrets hardcoded in source, config files, or CI workflows?
            - Are CI/CD actions pinned to SHA or just version tags? (supply chain risk)
            - Are IAM policies least-privilege, or do they use `Resource: *`?

            ### Investigation 4: Mobile App & Client Deep Dive

            For EVERY mobile app and client in the repo:
            - **Sync engine**: Does it push ALL fields the server stores? Are relationships/links
              synced or only entities? What happens when a sync push fails — is the local record
              purged anyway? Trace the full offline→create→sync→server cycle.
            - **Token/session lifecycle**: Is refresh race-free? Are there two mechanisms that
              could conflict? Is the session fully cleared on logout, including local databases?
            - **State management**: Are error states reachable with no recovery path? (empty
              screen, no retry button, dead-end UI)
            - **Concurrency**: Are there actors/dispatchers/scopes that could conflict? Is
              CancellationException properly re-thrown? (Kotlin) Is @MainActor used correctly? (Swift)

            ### Investigation 5: Infrastructure & Deployment

            Review the infrastructure as code and CI/CD:
            - **Networking**: Single points of failure? (single NAT, single AZ dependency)
            - **Database**: Deletion protection? Backup retention? Encryption?
            - **IAM**: Overly broad policies? (Resource: *)
            - **CI/CD**: Secrets in logs? Unpinned actions? Self-hosted runners on public repos?
            - **Deployment**: Rollback path for every component? Migration ordering correct?
            - **Monitoring**: Are there gaps in alerting? Unmonitored services?
            - **Cost**: Over-provisioned resources? Missing Spot usage?

            ### Investigation 6: Architectural Gaps & "The Why"

            Look for things that seem redundant, counter-intuitive, or asymmetric:
            - Does one service have a capability that a parallel service lacks?
            - Are there N+1 HTTP call patterns where one service calls another in a loop?
            - Is there code that looks "smelly" — not wrong exactly, but suspiciously complex
              or unnecessarily clever? Investigate before flagging.
            - What would a new engineer find confusing when onboarding?

            ### Agentic Freedom

            The investigations above are a framework, not a straitjacket. If you notice a
            specific module that seems particularly complex or failure-prone, prioritize a
            deep dive on that section even if it doesn't fit neatly into an investigation.
            The most valuable findings come from following threads, not from completing a
            checklist.

            ### Output for Mode 4
